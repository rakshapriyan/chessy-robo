A chess engine build with Stockfish &amp; Octoprint


## Inspiration
I came as a solo participant and wanted to find the inspiration during the Hackathon. After knowing this hackathon. I took it as a challenge and tried to work on it. Loved the way I tried to figure out the logic and got references from many other projects.
## What it does
It uses octoprint and python to create a chess engine. With GUI we can play chess with this engine. By pressing the corresponding keys we can able to play chess.

## How I built it
I started by building a console based application. Later by taking references from other repositories. I used different packages and tried using different methodologies. By using python, octoprint & Stockfish. I build this.
## Challenges I ran into
Working with a package under development was a bit challenging. And I worked in a pressurised environment where I took only 2 days to complete this. Resolving the errors was quite a bit challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building an application from scratch, with the help of a under development package and modules.
